rotate
======
Performs a rotation on each line of STDIN. The rotations can be given as euler
angles: phi, theta, psi or as quaternion: q1,q2,q3,q4.

Each line of stdin shall be provided as a comma separated triple: x,y,z.

Use p, h, f to represent pi, pi/2, and pi/4 respectively. This will use the
internal representations of pi defined in <math.h>.

Testing
=======
Run test.sh to verify that the code is working.
