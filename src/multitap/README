multitap
========
A tool for writing asynchronous inputs to multiple outputs.

Similar to tee, multitap reads input from STDIN and writes to the output files
provided on the command line. However, multitap differs by using non-blocking
I/O. Output files are only opened for writing when the file is already opened
for reading. If a file is not opened for reading when multitap is ready to
write, it is skipped until the next iteration.

This non-blocking behavior is useful for distributing sensor readings to
applications that run at different rates. Each client application can open its
respective FIFO for reading when it is ready for the latest sensor data,
ignoring any intermediate values.
