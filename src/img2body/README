img2body
========
Reads source and reflection image frame coordinates from STDIN and writes
normalized body frame coordinates. z-coordinate is omitted since it is 1 after
normalization.

Input should be of the form:
id,x1,y1,x2,y2

and output will be of the form:
id,x1,y1,x2,y2

Testing
======
test.sh compares the output of img2body using pixels.txt as input to the
Matout.txt file
